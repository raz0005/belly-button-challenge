# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to explore the microbial diversity of human navels. Using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, this dashboard provides insights into the various microbes that inhabit human belly buttons, visualizing the data through bar and bubble charts. The application is built using D3.js for data manipulation and Plotly.js for creating interactive charts.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu:** Allows users to select different individuals (samples) from the dataset to explore their microbial profiles.
- **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for the selected individual, showing the most abundant microbes.
- **Bubble Chart:** Visualizes all OTUs for the selected sample with varying sizes and colors representing the abundance and ID of each OTU.
- **Metadata Display:** Shows demographic information about the selected individual, including age, ethnicity, and gender.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js:** For data loading and manipulation.
- **Plotly.js:** For rendering interactive bar and bubble charts.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web interface.
